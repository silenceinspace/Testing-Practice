### Thoughts
Test driven development (TDD) is a very interesting way to develop applications. In a way, it reminds me of my inner expectations about how the app should eventually work. But without tests, I need to manually check if my app's outcomes are the expected ones or not with `console.log()`'s. In addition, I may need to spend a bit of time to debug my app by looking for potential erros. However, the test checking approach is what can help me avoid all of that. It is a useful method to firstly get very specific with what I want my app to output while helping me come up with an algorithm how to achieve it. It is important to write actually meaningful tests to know when and what to check, but so far I have pretty much liked TDD.
